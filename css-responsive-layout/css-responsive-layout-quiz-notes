## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  a specific screen width at which the layout or design of a webpage changes to provide an optimal user experience across different devices
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  there is flexibility across screen sizes, it allows elements to scale relative to their parent container's width
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  because it came AFTER in the stylesheet, the last rule wins in CSS
