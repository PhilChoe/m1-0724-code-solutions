## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  //The reuse the code (loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times), working with collections (you can iterate over each item in the collection and perform an operation on it), performance (it can be more efficient that repeating code), control flow (loops with conditional statements allow control of the flow of the program)
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  //the code will execute while the condition expression is true, it is used to indicate when the loop should terminate
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  //iteration in this context means that the code block will run
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  //it is checked before each iteration of the loop
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  //runs just once before the loop begins to iterate
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  //runs before each iteration of the loop
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  //gets evaluated after each iteration, once code inside the loops code block finishes, final expression gets evaluated then moves on to the conditional expression
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  //break;
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  //increments by 1 to the next element of the loop, increments the variable set in the initial expression and moves on to the next
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  //using an for in loop, you set variable key to represent each property of a certain object, then you increment through the key that is accessed by key
