## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  //called with (), it allows you to package code for later use in the program
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  //the function keyword, an optional name, zero or more parameters, a code block, an optional return statement
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  //function name, a comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  //once defined, a function is another kind of object, you must call the function for the code block to run, the definition contains parameters and the call contains arguments
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  //when we define a function, we declare parameters and when we call a function, we pass it arguments
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  //they are basically placeholders (with the type restricted at times (string vs number vs any vs unknown)) that is called with arguments when we call the function
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  //it causes the function to produce a value we can use in the program, prevents any more code in the code block from running
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  //function keyword is not used, and the => is used between the parameter list and code block
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  //it is the implicit return functionality, there is no return statement, no {}, and only one line of code (an expression)
